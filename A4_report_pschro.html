    <h2>Proposition: The United States has failed to address neonate and infant mortality.</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="a4_fig1.png" alt="" width = "1170"/>
				<figcaption>
					This figure shows each countries combined neonate and infant mortality rate in 1985 and 2019 (the most recent data) based on the Human Development Indicators reported by the World Bank. The countries are sorted in ascending order for each year, with countries achieving the lowest mortality rates at the top. The arrows show how each country changed in rank over time. The bar next to each country name represents the mortality rate, reported as the absolute death count per 1,000 live births. The graphic on the right reflects the relative difference in magnitude in mortality between the United States and leading countries.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Metric used for comparison
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1.5</li>
						<li>The visualization combines infant and neonatal mortality. Although neonates are commonly considered to be a subset of infants, neonatal mortality is often reported separately from infant mortality as it is generally associated with different risk factors and population characteristics. 1985 is selected as the starting year for comparison as many countries do not report neonate and infant mortality prior to this year. The U.S. performs worse with neonatal mortality than with infant mortality and performs significantly better with under-5 mortality than either neonatal or infant mortality. Therefore, using a metric that combines the worst categories for the U.S. results in it comparing less favorable with other countries. In addition, we report the absolute death counts out of 1,000 instead of percentages. Therefore, each unit increment of the value represents the lost life of an individual baby, which is more emotionally engaging than reporting percentages.  </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Focusing on rank versus absolute values, paired with the competitive framing in the title and caption
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -2</li>
						<li>The absolute mortality rate values significantly improve for all countries between 1985 and 2019 and the difference between the U.S. and leading countries is only about 0.4% in 2019. However, by focusing on rank instead of absolute differences, the figure makes it appear as though some countries (particularly the U.S.) have shown worse mortality rates over time. In addition, using rank leads to a competitive dynamic, where one country can only improve in rank if another country declines. This framing is misleading, as the mortality rates for all countries can improve in a manner that is not zero-sum. In addition, the countries are sorted according to their rank in an ascending order, with countries achieving the lowest mortality rates at the top. This creates the visual where the U.S. is falling to the bottom from left to right. This supports the figure title which describes the U.S. as falling behind the other countries.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>X-axis label size and rescaling between years
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -2</li>
						<li>The x axis has very small labels, which undermines the reader’s ability to recognize the relatively small differences in magnitude in the absolute death counts across countries. For example, in 2019, the absolute difference in mortality rate between the U.S. and leading countries is only 0.4% (4 out of 1,000 livebirths). In addition, the x axis is scaled differently across the years. This difference in scaling, paired with the focus on rank, makes it appear as though the mortality rate is larger in the U.S. in 2019, despite the fact that it is less than half of the 1985 value.						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Coloring and arrow angle
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1.5</li>
						<li>The figure is almost entirely grey or black, with red (the color of blood) used to represent the U.S. This draws the reader’s attention to the significant fall in the rank of the U.S. relative to other countries. In addition, the arrow for the U.S. projects downward from 1985 to 2019, while the arrows for all other countries project upward (regardless of their change in rank). This difference in angling obscures any drops in rank we see with other countries (e.g., New Zealand). I explored approaches that involved projecting the arrows upward for countries that increased in rank and downward for countries that decreased in rank. However, this made the fall in the U.S. rank seem less severe.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Graphic on right side highlighting the increased number of baby deaths in the United States
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1</li>
						<li>The graphic on the right depicts the relative difference in magnitude in mortality between the U.S. and leading countries. The graphic includes baby icons (covered in red) to emotionally appeal to the reader by visually representing the nature of the lives being lost. I also considered using the baby icons to represent the mortality rate for each country (instead of using the bars). However, this led to an over-usage of the baby imagery that diluted its impact relative to the single graphic.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="a4_fig2.png" alt="" width = "1170"/>
				<figcaption>
					This figure shows each countries combined neonatal and infant mortality rate, adjusted for rate of low birthweight (LBW) babies, for each year from 1960 to 2019 (the most recent data) based on the Human Development Indicators reported by the World Bank. The mortality rate is represented as a percentage and is adjusted using a standardization method, provided by <a  href="https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13690-023-01037-y">Jana et al., 2023</a>, that accounts for the rate of LBW babies (a variable that is influenced by population factors such as maternal age), which may lead to inflated death counts. The adjusted rate reflects the mortality rate among normal birthweight babies, providing insight into the healthcare quality of the country in a way that is independent of differences in birthweight distributions. 
				</figcaption>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Metric used for comparison
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -0.5</li>
						<li>This figure uses the same metric as the first figure, but adjusts for the rate of low birthweight (LBW) babies. It is a common practice to adjust neonate and infant mortality rates by LBW rate since countries with more LBW births (due to factors such as maternal age and multiple births) may have inflated death counts. In addition, some high-income countries (e.g., the U.S.) may have relatively high infant mortality rates partly because they have high survival rates for very premature LBW infants, who are still at higher risk of death. Adjusting for LBW helps isolate healthcare quality from differences in birth weight distributions. Since there are many missing values in the LBW reporting, this adjustment does not make a large difference in the mortality percentages. However, it has an overall favorable effect for the U.S. (which has a disproportionately large number of LBW babies) relative to other countries.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Focusing on absolute values instead of rank
					<ul>
						<li>Score: +1</li>
						<li>The first figure was deceptive in how it focused on rank over absolute values. This figure is more earnest, representing the absolute values on a simple line chart that allows readers to view the trends in a direct manner. One disadvantage of this visualization, however, is that all of the countries cluster near the bottom right of the plot, which makes it very difficult to make meaningful comparisons beyond 2000. This is an honest limitation of this visualization approach that happens to work in favor of the underlying goal of countering the above proposition.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Highlighting 1% mortality threshold 
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -0.5</li>
						<li>The figure includes a dashed line, along with a label, that highlights the 1% mortality threshold. Although 1% mortality is a convenient threshold to set as a target, it is arbitrary and the importance of continuing to decrease mortality rates does not meaningfully change once this threshold is achieved. In addition, the shading below the dashed line makes it more difficult to compare the different colored lines as they approach more recent years and further obscures the plateauing of the U.S.’s progress in recent years relative to other countries.  </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Obscuring change over time and focusing on number of years below 1% mortality
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1</li>
						<li>Overall, the line chart layout seems like the most straightforward to represent mortality over time and allow for fair comparison across countries. However, since all the countries converge to less than 1% in the later decades, the chart does not allow for useful comparison of more recent mortality levels. In fact, you cannot even see the fact that the U.S. ends up with the highest mortality rate among all countries included in the figure due to the overcrowding of the datapoints near 2019. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Sorting county names based on number of years below threshold instead of current mortality rates
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1.5</li>
						<li>The figure sorts the countries in descending order based on the number of years the country has achieved less than 1% mortality, with the U.S. listed at the top. The figure awards the U.S. for its long-term success with reaching this threshold, distracting from the fact that the U.S. has underperformed all other countries in recent years. A more earnest visualization would highlight the extent to which countries are dropping below 1% mortality, instead of simple counting the number of years the country falls somewhere below this arbitrary threshold. There is a meaningful difference between achieving less than 0.2% mortality (as done by San Marino and Slovenia in 2019) compared to 0.5% to 1% mortality (as done by the U.S.) and the figure does not adequately reflect this difference.   </li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Throughout the design process for both visualizations, I grappled with the balance between persuasive and misleading visual storytelling. One of the most challenging aspects was identifying where the line should be drawn between making an argument compelling and distorting reality. The first visualization, which aimed to support the proposition, relied on rank-based framing and emotionally charged imagery to emphasize the relative decline of the U.S. in neonate and infant mortality. Although this approach was effective in communicating the argument, it also obscured some critical contextual details, such as the overall improvement in mortality rates globally. The second visualization, which argued against the proposition, attempted to be more earnest by focusing on absolute values and adjusting for low birthweight rates. However, even in this case, choices such as emphasizing the 1% mortality threshold and obscuring recent differences among countries still shaped the viewer’s perception in a way that could be considered misleading.</p>

		<p>This experience has reshaped my understanding of ethical analysis and visualization. Ethical visualization does not mean complete neutrality—every choice made in data selection, transformation, and presentation inherently involves framing a narrative. However, ethical visualization should aim to minimize distortions that mislead the viewer into false conclusions. Acceptable persuasive choices involve emphasizing particular aspects of the data while still allowing for a fair and reasonable interpretation of the broader trends. Misleading choices, on the other hand, involve omitting key context, distorting scales, or using visual cues to drive conclusions that are not supported by the underlying data. Ultimately, an ethical approach to visualization requires transparency about the choices made, as well as a commitment to presenting data in a way that informs rather than manipulates.</p>
