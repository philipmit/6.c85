Description:
The U.S. Census Bureau does not officially define neighborhood boundaries for Boston. To facilitate demographic and statistical analysis, Census block groups have been aggregated to approximate neighborhood boundaries. These boundaries allow for the reporting and visualization of Census data at the neighborhood level. Census block groups are statistical geographic subdivisions created for the tabulation of data from the decennial census and the American Community Survey.

This dataset is primarily used for work that relies on Census data. For non-Census-based analysis, the official Boston neighborhood boundaries should be referenced.
